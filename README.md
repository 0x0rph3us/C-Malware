# C-Malware
A collection of C/C++ malware to use on multiple devices

This is an archive of some malware written in C++ (my language of choice for writing malware), use it at your own risk since this is only for educational purposes and not for any malicious or illegal purposes.

Some of these programs might contain minor errors but it's nothing some research and googling won't fix.

I will continue uploading malware files once I write more and the ideas come to me.
